#     This is an example of an analysis model.
#     dbt's notion of models makes it easy for data teams to version control and collaborate on data transformations. 
#     Sometimes though, a certain sql statement doesn't quite fit into the mold of a dbt model. 
#     These more "analytical" sql files can be versioned inside of your dbt project using the analysis functionality of dbt.
